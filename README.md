Business Problem: For this project the business problem was to make ML model for predicting medical expense.
The dataset 'insurance.csv' having 1338 rows and 7 columns has been used here for exploring different insights by visualization as well as building model for prediction of Expense.Here I used Linear regression Model here.
Also for any new instance or entry to this dataset I used KNN(K-nearest Neighbor Regression) for predicting what can be the expense of it.
