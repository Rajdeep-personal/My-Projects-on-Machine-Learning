# My-Projects-on-Machine-Learning
Business Problem: For this project the business problem was to make ML model for predicting medical expense.
The dataset 'insurance.csv' having 1338 rows and 7 columns has been used here for exploring different insights by visualization as well as building model for prediction of Expense.Here I used Linear regression Model here.
Also for any new instance or entry to this dataset I used KNN(K-nearest Neighbor Regression) in order to predict how many nearest neighbors are needed to predict the expense of it. Performed Grid Search also to check if there is any improvement in the score .
